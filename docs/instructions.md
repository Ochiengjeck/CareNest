Public facing

Design and implement public-facing side of this platform. The site should feature high-quality imagery, elegant visuals, and a polished, contemporary aesthetic.

Adhere strictly to UI/UX best practices, including:

* Full responsiveness across all devices
* Support for both light and dark modes
* Accessibility and performance optimization
* Consistent spacing, typography, and visual hierarchy

Use the system’s currently configured theme as the base styling reference to ensure brand consistency.

For any sections or content that are not yet available in the system, include clearly labeled placeholder components. After implementation, provide a consolidated list of these placeholders so they can be reviewed and prioritized for future development.
