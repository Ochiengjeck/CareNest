Redesign Directive

Redesign the entire system into a modern, visually appealing, and user-centric interface that aligns with current UI/UX best practices.

The design must be:

Fully responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices (mobile-first approach preferred).

Accessible (WCAG-aware contrast, readable typography, intuitive navigation).

Consistent in spacing, typography, iconography, and interaction patterns.

Optimized for performance and usability, not just aesthetics.

Dynamic Theming & Color Management

The system must support dynamic theming, with all color configurations manageable from the admin panel. Administrators should be able to:

Select from predefined, professionally curated color templates.

Switch themes without redeploying or rebuilding the system.

Extend or customize themes in the future if needed.

    Predefined Color Templates

    Ocean Blue #2872A1 + Cloudy Sky #CBDDE9 (Default theme)

    Soft Sage #ACC8A2 + Deep Olive #1A2517

    Deep Burgundy #5B0E14 + Golden Sand #F1E194

    Vibrant Orange #FD802E + Deep Navy #233D4C

    Blush Peach #FFD2C2 + Muted Teal #789A99

    Pale Cream #FEFACD + Royal Violet #5F4A8B

Additional Design Requirements

Support light/dark compatibility where applicable.

Use scalable components and design tokens to ensure maintainability.

Ensure all UI components adapt correctly to theme changes (buttons, charts, tables, modals, alerts, etc.).

Maintain brand neutrality so the system can be reused across different clients or deployments.
